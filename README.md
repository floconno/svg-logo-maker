# svg-logo-maker

## Description
This repository contains two JavaScript files that work together utilizing Node.js, Inquirer, and Jest, to create a command-line application that generates an SVG logo for the user. Their are 3 tests wihtin the shapes.test.js file that test each shape class and the ability to properly render the shapes. Jest is used to run these tests in the command-line. The application is first invoked by the user by running node index.js in the command-line, the user then follows a series of prompts created using the Inquirer package. The user is asked what text they would like in their logo, the color of the text they would like, the shape they would like for their logo (choices being triangle, square, and circle), and lastly, what color they would like the shape of the logo to be. Once the user completes the prompts, a logo.svg file is created with the matching criteria entered by the user. When the logo.svg file is opened in a browser, the user is shown their customized logo. This application is great for anyone looking to create simple SVG logo that allows them to customize text, color of text, shape, and color of the shape.
